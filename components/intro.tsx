          I&apos;m a web developer based in Marbella, Spain.<br />
          During my time at the Ironhack bootcamp, I developed strong skills in modern technologies and agile methodologies, enabling me to build high-quality web applications.<br />
          My previous training in JavaScript at Coderhouse further strengthened my foundation and problem-solving abilities in front-end development.<br />
          I&apos;m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I have experience working with Agile methodologies and Git version control.<br />
          Before transitioning into tech, I developed teamwork and adaptability in fast-paced environments during buffet and kitchen services.<br />
          My short-term goal is to continue enhancing my technical expertise and problem-solving skills as a Full Stack Developer on innovative projects.<br />
          Outside of technology, my lifelong passion for football has taught me the value of teamwork, leadership, and strategic decision-makingâ€”qualities I bring to every professional endeavor.
