Petinder is a communityâ€‘driven pet adoption platform Iâ€™ve been volunteering on since early 2025. Our mission was simple but powerful: **help animals find forever homes** by connecting shelters and adopters through an intuitive web app.

## Why Petinder?

As a longâ€‘time animal lover, I wanted to put my developer skills to good use. Petinderâ€™s team welcomed me as a volunteer, and together we:

-  **Collaborated on ongoing UI/UX improvements** to enhance user experience 
-  **Supported design continuity** by refining existing components and layouts 
-  **Contributed to feature enhancements**, like pet profiles and filter usability 
-  **Worked closely with teammates** to maintain design consistency and functionality

## Tech Stack

We chose a modern, familiar stack to ship fast:

```bash
# Frontend
Next.js + Tailwind CSS
# Backend
Node.js + Express
# Database
MongoDB Atlas

```
<Counter />


### Whatâ€™s Next?
Petinder support 11 of the 17 UN SDGs, working to achieve 74 associated goals out of 169.. Iâ€™m proud to have helped shape a project that truly makes a differenceâ€”one adoption at a time.
