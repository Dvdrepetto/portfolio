Petinder is a community‑driven pet adoption platform I’ve been volunteering on since early 2025. Our mission was simple but powerful: **help animals find forever homes** by connecting shelters and adopters through an intuitive web app.

## Why Petinder?

As a long‑time animal lover, I wanted to put my developer skills to good use. Petinder’s team welcomed me as a volunteer, and together we:

-  **Collaborated on ongoing UI/UX improvements** to enhance user experience 
-  **Supported design continuity** by refining existing components and layouts 
-  **Contributed to feature enhancements**, like pet profiles and filter usability 
-  **Worked closely with teammates** to maintain design consistency and functionality

## Tech Stack

We chose a modern, familiar stack to ship fast:

```bash
# Frontend
Next.js + Tailwind CSS
# Backend
Node.js + Express
# Database
MongoDB Atlas

```
<Counter />


### What’s Next?
Petinder contributes to 11 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supporting over 70 related targets through its core mission—promoting responsible pet adoption and community awareness. I’m proud to have played a role in building a platform that makes a meaningful impact, one adoption at a time.
