## [🔗 Live Demo](https://dvdrepetto.github.io/game-proyect-module1/)

The Sharingan is an interactive browser game built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript OOP. Players must track and click on moving targets before time runs out, practicing precision, speed and eye–hand coordination through progressively harder levels.

## Features
 
- **Timer & Levels:** Complete each level within the countdown to advance.  
- **Survive** as long as possible while controlling the ball.
- **Clean OOP Structure:** Game logic organized in classes for easy maintenance and extension.

## Technologies

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for game layout.  
- **CSS3:** Flexbox & keyframe animations for smooth visuals.  
- **JavaScript OOP:** Classes and modules to separate game state, rendering, and input handling.  

## Getting Started

## Conclusion

The Sharingan showcases core front‑end skills and OOP design in JavaScript. 
It’s a fun, lightweight demo of modular code, animations and user interaction—all without external frameworks.
