Petinder is a communityâ€‘driven pet adoption platform Iâ€™ve been volunteering on since early 2025. Our mission was simple but powerful: **help animals find forever homes** by connecting shelters and adopters through an intuitive web app.

## Why Petinder?

As a longâ€‘time animal lover, I wanted to put my developer skills to good use. Petinderâ€™s team welcomed me as a volunteer, and together we:

- **Defined requirements** with shelter coordinators  
- **Set up agile sprints** to iterate quickly  
- **Designed wireframes** for pet profiles and search filters  

## Tech Stack

We chose a modern, familiar stack to ship fast:

```bash
# Frontend
React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS
# Backend
Node.js + Express
# Database & Storage
MongoDB Atlas + Cloudinary for pet images

```
<Counter />


### Whatâ€™s Next?
Petinder is now live in two local shelters, and weâ€™re planning a mobile app feature next. Iâ€™m proud to have helped shape a project that truly makes a differenceâ€”one adoption at a time.
